    "**Built-in Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are functions that are always available in Python without needing to import any module. For example:\n",
    "1. `input()`: Reads a line from input, usually from the user.\n",
    "2. `print()`: Outputs the specified message to the console or other standard output device.\n",
    "3. `type()`: Returns the type of the specified object.\n",
    "4. `round()`: Rounds a floating-point number to a specified number of digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special Constructs**\n",
    "1. F-string (`f\"\"`): A special syntax introduced in Python 3.6 or above for string formatting. It allows embedding expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`. This enables dynamic insertion of values and expressions directly within the string.\n",
    "2. Format Method (`str.format()`): Allows you to format strings by inserting variables or expressions into placeholders marked by curly braces `{}` within the string. If the specified curly braces are more than one, then the placeholders are applied consecutively."
